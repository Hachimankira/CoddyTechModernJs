Modern JavaScript Challenges for Beginners
==========================================

Welcome to my repository where I share the final challenges and solutions from the **Coddy Tech Modern JavaScript for Beginners** course. This repository includes solutions to several interesting JavaScript coding challenges, designed to test and improve various programming skills.

Challenges Included
-------------------

1.  Mario (Less):

    -   A challenge inspired by the classic Mario game. Implement a function to generate a less challenging version of the game's pyramid.
2.  Mario (More):

    -   Building on the previous challenge, create a more complex version of the Mario game's pyramid.
3.  Credit Card Number Validation:

    -   Validate credit card numbers using Luhn's Algorithm. This challenge involves checking if a card number is valid and determining the card type based on its number.
4.  Substitution Cipher:

    -   Implement a substitution cipher function to encrypt messages based on a given key. Ensure the encrypted result maintains the same case as the original input.
